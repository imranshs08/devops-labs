DevOps Fundamentals: What You Need to Learn

Core DevOps Principles

Collaboration: Understand how development and operations integrate, breaking down silos for better communication and shared responsibility.

Automation: Learn to automate repetitive tasks—builds, testing, deployments, infrastructure setup—to reduce errors and speed up delivery.

Continuous Improvement: Foster a mindset focused on ongoing process, code, and infrastructure enhancements guided by feedback loops.

Customer-Centric Action: Adapt quickly to user needs with frequent, small, reliable software updates.

Key DevOps Practices

Continuous Integration (CI): Integrate code into shared repositories often, using automated tests to detect issues early.

Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD): Automate the release pipeline for code to flow smoothly toward production; understand deployment pipelines, staging, and canary releases.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Use tools like Terraform or Ansible to define and manage infrastructure in code, enabling consistency and version control.

Monitoring and Logging: Use tools to measure system health, collect logs, and send alerts to identify and respond to incidents proactively.

Security Integration (DevSecOps): Embed security checks into every stage of the process—scanning, policy-as-code, and secure configurations.

Essential Technical Skills
Area	What to Learn	Example Tools/Technologies
Source Code Management	Version control workflows, branching, reviews	Git, GitHub, GitLab
CI/CD Pipeline Building	Creating and maintaining pipelines	Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions
Scripting & Automation	Automating jobs and infrastructure	Python, Bash, PowerShell
Containerization	Container concepts, image management, orchestration	Docker, Kubernetes
Cloud Platforms	Deployment, resource management, automation	AWS, Azure, GCP
Configuration Management	Automating server setup and changes	Ansible, Chef, Puppet
Monitoring/Observability	Setup & interpret dashboards, log analysis	Grafana, Prometheus, ELK

Communication: Effectively share knowledge and feedback among cross-functional teams.

Problem Solving: Address incidents methodically, automate fixes where possible.

Continuous Learning: Adapt to new tools and best practices as the DevOps landscape evolves.

DevOps Lifecycle Stages & Tools Overview:
Lifecycle Stage	Typical Tools	Goals
Plan	Jira, Confluence	Define work, facilitate collaboration
Build/Code	GitHub, GitLab	Version control, collaboration
Test	Selenium, JUnit	Automated, reliable tests
Release/Deploy	Jenkins, Argo CD	Frequent, repeatable releases
Operate/Monitor	ELK, Grafana, Prometheus	Availability, performance insights
Continuous Feedback	Slack, Jira Service Mgmt	Fast, actionable user and system feedback


Cultural Principles

Transparency: Ensure visibility into both code and operations to align teams.

Shared Responsibility: Both Dev and Ops own application uptime and quality from creation to production.

Cross-Functional Teams: Include ops, dev, QA, and security in every lifecycle stage.

Continuous Feedback: Embed feedback loops to rapidly fix and optimize processes and products.


Interview Questions :


What is DevOps and why is it important?

Explain the concept of CI/CD. How have you implemented or used CI/CD pipelines?

What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)? Which tools have you used and how?

Describe your experience with source code management tools. What workflows or branching strategies have you used?

How do you automate builds, tests, and deployments? Name the tools and describe the process.

What is containerization? How have you worked with Docker and/or Kubernetes in your projects?

How do you set up monitoring and logging for applications and infrastructure?

Describe how you ensure security is integrated into your DevOps processes (DevSecOps).

Explain how you handle configuration management and what tools you have used (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet).

Can you describe a time you handled an incident or outage? What steps did you take and what did you learn?



Scenario-Based DevOps Interview Questions (From Discussed Topics)

CI/CD Pipeline Issue:

You notice build failures happening frequently in your CI/CD pipeline.

How would you approach troubleshooting and fixing the issue to restore smooth automated deployments?

IaC Change Gone Wrong:
A recent Terraform/Ansible change caused infrastructure misconfiguration in production.

What steps would you follow to identify the root cause, roll back the change, and prevent it in the future?

Source Code Management Challenge:
Your team is facing merge conflicts and inconsistent branching strategies with Git.

What workflow or branching policy would you suggest and how would you onboard the team to it?

Automation Script Failure:
A critical deployment script (Bash/Python) suddenly fails during a production release.

How do you debug, fix, and restore automation scripts with minimal downtime?

Container Crash Troubleshooting:
After deploying a new microservice on Kubernetes, some pods stay in CrashLoopBackOff state.

Explain your diagnostic steps and how you’d resolve the deployment issue.

Cloud Resource Spike:
Monitoring tools show a sudden spike in cloud resource usage and costs.

What actions would you take to investigate, optimize, and prevent unnecessary spend?

Configuration Drift Detected:
You notice prod servers are no longer consistent due to missed Ansible runs.

How do you bring environments back in sync and enforce configuration management best practices?

Security in the Pipeline:
Your build and deployment pipeline needs to comply with new security policies (DevSecOps).

How would you ensure secrets management and security checks are integrated?

Incident Response:
An application outage leads to service downtime.

Walk through your incident response process, including communication with stakeholders and post-incident lessons learned.

Monitoring and Alerts Overload:
The team receives too many false-positive alerts from the monitoring system.

How would you tune alerting to ensure only actionable incidents are notified?
