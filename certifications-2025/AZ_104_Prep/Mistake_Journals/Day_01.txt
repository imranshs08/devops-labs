Note: The question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements.
1. Your company has an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) subscription.
You want to implement an Azure AD conditional access policy.
The policy must be configured to require members of the Global Administrators group to use Multi-Factor Authentication and an Azure AD-joined device when they connect to Azure AD from untrusted locations.
Solution: You access the multi-factor authentication page to alter the user settings.
Does the solution meet the goal?

A. Yes
B. No

Ans : No, 

To meet the goal:

You need to configure a Conditional Access policy in Azure AD:

Go to: Azure AD > Security > Conditional Access.

Create a new policy.

Target users: Select the Global Administrators group.

Cloud apps: Choose appropriate apps or "All cloud apps".

Conditions:

Locations: Configure to include "All locations" and exclude "trusted locations".

Access controls:

Grant access but require MFA and require device to be Azure AD joined.

✅ That setup would meet the goal.

3. You are planning to deploy an Ubuntu Server virtual machine to your company's Azure subscription.
You are required to implement a custom deployment that includes adding a particular trusted root certification authority (CA).
Which of the following should you use to create the virtual machine?

A. The New-AzureRmVm cmdlet.
B. The New-AzVM cmdlet.
C. The Create-AzVM cmdlet.
D. The az vm create command

Ans : D. The az vm create command

4. Your company's Azure solution makes use of Multi-Factor Authentication for when users are not in the office. The Per Authentication option has been configured as the usage model.
After the acquisition of a smaller business and the addition of the new staff to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) obtains a different company and adding the new employees to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you are informed that these employees should also make use of Multi-Factor Authentication.
To achieve this, the Per Enabled User setting must be set for the usage model.
Solution: You create a new Multi-Factor Authentication provider with a backup from the existing Multi-Factor Authentication provider data.
Does the solution meet the goal?

Ans : No

5. Your company has an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named weyland.com that is configured for hybrid coexistence with the on-premises Active
Directory domain.
You have a server named DirSync1 that is configured as a DirSync server.
You create a new user account in the on-premise Active Directory. You now need to replicate the user information to Azure AD immediately.
Solution: You restart the NetLogon service on a domain controller.
Does the solution meet the goal?

Ans : 

As described here:
If you need to manually run a sync cycle, then from PowerShell run Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta.

To initiate a full sync cycle, run Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Initial from a PowerShell prompt.

Running a full sync cycle can be very time consuming, so if you need to replicate the user information to Azure AD immediately then run Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta.
Answer is B. No
